New release of simbatch

Changelog 20/02/2007:
    - Bug fixes with new CVS version (error code)
    - Replace MSG_parallel_task_execute with a MSG_process_sleep 
    (far less realistic but works better and do just what I need, sorry)

Changelog :
	
	- Break law 1 of the Martin's laws aka "Avoid dependencies"
	- Depends Cmake >= 2.2 and libxml2
	- Those two libraries are portable and easily instalable on every systems
	- Conf files are now in xml (miss a DTD and some stuff to check)
	- Simbatch now compile on macosX and allows "make -j nb_procs" thanks to cmake
	
	- Clean the code :
		- Just one lib now (and plugins) : libsimbatch.so
		- Just one file for scheduling utilities (scheduling.c)
		- No more client (it's just an example)
		- Internal load is a client or an internal load to simulate 
		non dedicated platform. (If you need a specific client, you could use 
		the client.c provided)
		- No need to send a "end task" to well terminate a simulation
		- some bug fixes

Install:
	- I suggest to create a build directory and to go in it.
	- Write ccmake .. (set the compilation flags)
	- make -j n && make install 
	- Install is local for the moment
	- Last, you just have to tweak your library path. Copy and paste "export lines"
	printed by cmake ..
