\section{Compiling Simbatch}

\subsection{Dependencies}

To compile Simbatch, you will need to have:

\begin{itemize}
  \item a *nix environment
  \item simgrid >= 3.1
  \item cmake >= 2.4
  \item libxml2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

Go in the Simbatch source directory. Then, create a directory to build
the project (mkdir build) and go inside (cd build). Then, to generate
the Make file automatically, we use cmake (ccmake ..). When the GUI is
launched, you can specify the options. Finally, you just have to
compile the project (make install). The simbatch library is then
created and can be used. Do not forget to add the library path to the
environment variables with export (DY)LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH

\subsection {testing the installation}

Go in example/batch and try to run the example (make and then
./example -f simbatch.xml). if there is no error, your installation is
ready.
