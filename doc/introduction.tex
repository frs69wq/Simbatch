\section{Introduction}

Grids have become a tool widely used in computer science. They permit
to compute a huge amount of tasks in a reasonable time. When computer
scientists try to developp new algorithms for the grid, one of their
main problem is the difficulty to reproduce results. The aim of
simgrid \cite{simgrid} is to provide an efficient and powerful grid
simulator.

An aspect of simgrid that is not taken into account is the batch
reservation systems. Simbatch is a C API build on top of simgrid. The
API is designed to simulate batch reservation tools execution in a
Grid environment.
